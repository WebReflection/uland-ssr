## API

```js
import {Component, render, html, useState} from 'uland-ssr';

const Counter = Component((initialState) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialState);
  return html`
  <button onclick=${() => setCount(count + 1)}>
    Count: ${count}
  </button>`;
});

// basic example, creates the expected output
// minus online events (would need re-hydration)
render(String, () => html`
  <div>
    A bounce of counters.<hr>
    ${Counter(0)} ${Counter(1)}
  </div>
`);
```
